This is a little exercise to test your knowledge. See for yourself ;)

- take a look at the code and fix it
- focus is on naming/layout & basic SEO conventions
- once the html is clean we'll add `js`

We'll discuss every step of the exercise, all questions are welcome.
Feel free to change the design at your leisure :)

Happy hacking!
